# Exploration (of Mathematics in Haskell)

My exploration of pure maths in Haskell. The structure
is such that for each "branch" module (conceptuall),
there is a Module.Definition which contains the basic
definition(s).

Installation should be easy if you have stack:

> stack install

I'm really looking for comments and criticisms on this one.
